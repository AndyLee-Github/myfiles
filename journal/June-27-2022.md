Today I got up early, but the traffic was bad. When I arrived the company, it was 7:30. I didn't run for exercise because it was late.

The first thing I did was to plan today, then I wrote the journals that I didn't finish in the previous days. After that, I started to prepare the Lamer meeting and had this meeting. By the way, I shouldn't consider too much for others, it makes me tired. Now I am a manager and TPM, I need to use my time more efficently.

At noon, I finished my lunch quickly, and I felt tired, so I had a nap. When time came to 13:00, I went to one meeting office and had some shadowing practice with Steve Jobs speech. After that I watched some videos of Rachel's English.

In the afternoon, I tried to study some knowledge about docker, but again I was interrupted frequently, I finished one articles until 20:00 o'clock. And I had some meeting and conversation about Genie project, I tried to manage others in communication and it had some good results, keep going.

At night, I arrived home lately, and still tired. But I opened the light of study room, which made me do some good things, such as handling the hexo blog, writing this journal.

Should I keep driving or taking subway every day? I still don't have the answer yet.
