Today I got up lately again because I slept lately last night. 

I drove on the highway and encoutered a crowd traffic. It took me more me more than one hour. If I got up earlier, it won't happen.

Today I went to company to have a overtime. Becuase of :
1. The PM promised the customer easily. - I need to correct it in the future.
2. The collegues didn't complete their work well. - I need to correct it too.
3. I promised to fix these thing easily. - I need to control my words.

When I arrived home, I felt tired again and do nothing.

I am thinking again whether I should go to office by subway. On this way, there is not bad traffic and maybe I can learn someting on the subway. The only thing is that I will be faint sometimes.

Learning to manage others and save my life.
