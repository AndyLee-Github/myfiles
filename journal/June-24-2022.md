Today I was busy with a lot of unimportant things, like man month confirmation, meetings, useless comunications.

I slept lately last night because of watching useless video, and got up lately today. When I arrived the company, it is almost ten past thirty. So I didn't have too much time to do things in the morning. I just hosted the ticket's checking meeting of Lamer. By the way, most collegues come to company at the time, this should not be a good thing for my company. 

At noon, I didn't follow my plan to learn and to save my time. I just played with my phone and took a nap. 

In the afternoon, I ordered a meeting room to learn, I didn't have a good efficiency. And another people come in and I leave him the meeting room.
When I sat in my seat, I am always interuppted by wechat/feishu/people, etc.

I had a requirement confirmation meeting with PM and another one, we spent too much time on this meeting and didn't have a good result. I also said a lot of unnecessary words, which is not related to my work. This is a bad thing, need to change it.

At night, I thought this is friday and I am too tired, so I just played with phone.

Today, for me, I need to manage my time and the other people to save my life.

I need to learn how to manage the others to reduce my works, and to make my life easier.

I found writing journal seems to make me calm down. good.
