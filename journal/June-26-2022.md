Today is a rainy day, I haven't left my home the whole day.

I got up late to make up sleep. And I stayed with my daughter. Sometimes I was thinking I should learn something when I am with my daughter, which is a very bad habbit. 
Just like the Green Book said, It should be:
"Whatever you do, do it a hundred percent. When your work, work, when you laugh, laugh. when you eat, eat like it's your last meal."

In the afternoon, My wife and I watched a not good movie "Moon Fall" and  a good movie Nemo.

At night, I tried to make my blog and journal perfect, and I didn't read. 

Keep going, my buddy!
