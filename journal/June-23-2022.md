Throughout my thirties, I regularly made resolutions, I was obessed!

Today is the first day I make my resolution and use Dida again. It is sad that I alwasy fail to stick on my plan.  There should be two reasons for failing;
1. I am not good at self-control yet, and I don't have strong heart.
2. I am busy, I couldn't find a good way to use my time reasonablely.

I didn't spend today very well. Wechat, collegue, Feishu, meeting interrupted me too many times. I skimed and read some meterial reactively, such as English brain map, this maybe only wastes time.

At noon, I watched Bilibili and I wasted more 30 minutes, the worst thing is that it makes me lazy not active.

At night, I arrived home lately, just read a while, no power to do the other things.
I need to find a way to solve this problem.
- How to get energy
- How to use my time well, do things with Tomato clock?
