Again a late hello to 2023.

Until today I have came to Siemens more than 1 months. My thinking is refreshed again, I had thought it was somehow good to stay at Thundersoft because I had stocks and acted as a manager. After I came here, I don't need to struggle with the bunch of useless things, and most of the time I can do what I like to do. Also I can have a easier work time, which almost not need to take overtime. Very happy that I decided to abandon my stocks and came here, no doubt that a big difference will be made this year.

Once I am at home, my kid will keep stick on me. Although I am still struggling with how to balance life and learning, I kind of having some ideas to make the balance and enjoy my life.

This year my main target is to follow my own principles and a I-will-stick-on plan with agile way. Currently my own principles are not done yet, I will publish it once it is done.

Ah... Almost 12:00 PM, I am tired and don't want to write too much now. So this is it.

Be better, and write the yearly hello on January since 2024.
