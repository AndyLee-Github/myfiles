# Algorithm
Title: [Remove Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/).  
Solution: [Java](https://github.com/huaqianlee/LeetcodeSolutions/blob/master/algorithms/java/RemoveElement.java).

# Review
I found a usage of "repo init ... --reference" this week, I want to know more, so I read [Android Repo Mirroring](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/software/guide-android-repo-mirroring-t3170869) this week.

This article explains "repo mirroring" in a simple and clear way through examples.

# Tips
Download android code from local mirror(code). As follows:
```bash
repo init -u url -b <branch> --reference=<local_dir>
```
It could increase download speed and save the storage when we want to keep multiple sets of code.
