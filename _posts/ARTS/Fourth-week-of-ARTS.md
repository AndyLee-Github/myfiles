# Review
Today I access [Medium](),This article called [`Putting comments in code: the good, the bad, and the ugly.`](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/code-comments-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-be9cc65fbf83) got into my eyes first. So I choose it as my ``Review``.

This article mainly says the cliche `“Good code is self-documenting.”` It tells the good, the bad, and the ugly when it comes to commenting our code. 

# Tips
In my job, I always build the android source code or capture some logs. I just named the logs manually before, forgot to named them automaticly. This week I remember the followsing way.
```bash
CMD | tee build-$(date "+%Y%m%d-%H%M%S").log # Generate build log
```
