# Reading

## Ways

If my purpose is to learn, I read in three steps:

*   I pre-read the book super fast. I’ll read a 400-500 page book in 4-5 minutes to find out what’s in it, and if it’s anything I need to know. I want to be able to determine in 5 minutes: Should I even read this? Is this the right book?
*   If it is the right book, then I’ll look for what I know, and what I don’t know, and need to learn. I don’t waste time learning what I know, I look for what I don’t know and need to learn. I look for what I don’t understand and what is relevant to me. I don’t need to know everything. I only need to what I need to know. Too many people spend too much time trying to learn everything and then they don’t remember anything. And to me what’s important is knowing the answers to the test questions if you’re in school, or knowing what your supervisors and clients want to know if you’re in business
*   Then the final step, I look for meaning and significance in what confused me, so now I understand it, and then I use memory skills to lock it in

Ask yourself some questions, what do you want to know? what do you want get? knownedge or questions?
summary and answer the questions!

## The 5 things you need to learn any subject.

*   The vocabulaary

*   Names. Who's in your book and what did they do?

*   Any number,date, statistic or formula. What is it and how do you use it?

*   In any non-fiction book with headers and sub-headers, what are the five most important ideas in each section, the big takeaways?

*   What are the questions and answers? If you know every word and what it means, every person and what they did, every number, date, statistic and formula and how it’s used, if you know every main idea and the answers to every question, you’re going to get an A.

### The vocabulaary

I like to use four by six, or three by five index cards.On one side I write the word, and on the other side I write the meaning.

if you make a mistake, **get a pad and I write it out correctly 25 times while saying it aloud**:
Let me give you an example with a biological term, Agelaius phoeniceus, it’s a red-winged blackbird.
\-> Agelaius phoeniceus, red-wing blackbird(write and saying it aloud)

Now you’re saying it with your mouth, you’re hearing it with your ears, you’re seeing it with your eyes, and you’re writing it with your pen. Those are all different types of memory. There’s muscle memory from writing, there’s another memory from speaking, there’s an auditory memory from hearing, and then there’s the visual memory.

Don’t waste time on what you already know

## What to look for when reading a book

Michael Frank: What should we be looking for when we’re reading a book and covering new material that we’re completely unfamiliar with?

Howard Berg: I like to look for the nouns and verbs. The people, places, things and their actions. I also put a lot of focus on the first and last sentence in a paragraph. Usually the first sentence tells you what’s coming, and the last sentence tells you what came.

I call it the bread trail. A lot of times people will say, this is such a big book, what am I supposed to learn? I ask them: What did the writer do to make things stand out? Did they bold? Did they use colors? Do they have tables, charts, diagrams, sidebars? Are there questions? Is there contents, an index, a glossary? What did they do that looks special or different to draw your attention?

## Questions to ask when reading a book

It depends on the subject, but I’m always asking myself:

How will I use this?

Why is this important?

What applications does it have for the problem I’m trying to solve?

And then I try to visualize myself in the future using what I’m learning and being very successful as a result.

## How to increase your reading speed

One minute timer, examin your speed, and then follow your finger.

## How to take notes

My favorite way to take notes is in a table with three or four columns.

The first column is where you write what you’re learning.

The second column is where you write your insights. What’s the significance of what you just heard?

The third column is where you write how you will use what you’ve just learned. When you see how it will benefit you, then you’ll learn it.

And then there’s a forth column if you’re a teacher or a writer like we are. The fourth column is where you write down what the presenter or writer did to grab your attention and excite you. Was it a story? Was it a joke? Was it an anecdote? You can now use that strategy as a speaker or a writer yourself to grab people’s attention and interest. So now instead of simply just writing what you’re learning, you’re also getting the insights, the application and what made it intriguing.

# Learning

## The Pomodoro Technique

25 minutes and reward, like wechat, your favorite song...

You may catch your thoughs wandering, that's normal, as soon as you do just bring it back.

If you have worked really hard and long on a certain subject say math, I recommend doing something a little different.

## Sleep

It's often better to do difficult things in the morning before thos metabolites have kicked in.

## Focus and diffuse concentration

That’s why learning involves going back and forth between focused and diffuse modes, because when you’re focusing you’re taking it in, and when you’re in defuse mode you’re putting together what you’ve already taken in. And that putting together in the diffuse mode is often, it seems, where creativity arises.

## Visualization

Picture what you are learning.
Envision yourself being successfuul at what you're working on.
Pretend you are the concept you're trying to understand(like you are friends.)\\

## Questions to ask

Some good questions to ask when you’re learning something new:

“What was the key idea here?”

“What did I really grasp?”

“Did I really learn it?”

“Can I recall it or use it independently of having the book open right in front of me?”

## Reading

When you’re reading a book, there’s a couple of keys to remember.

Skim the chapter first, first off do a picture walk. Five minutes is enough.

Don't highlight everything

Try to remember the key idea of the page. (summarize in the margins what a key idea is)

Recall method > concept mapping: just reading the page then looking away to see if you can recall the key idea is actually far more effective than rereading the page, highlighting or underlining the page, or using concept mapping on the page.

- flashcards and practise test

- Start with the Hardest questions, pull off as soon as you get stuck, go work on something else easier. then start on another hard problem. pull off, go back to something easier, and then go back to that hardest problem. ...

- Explain it in a way a 5-year-old could understand
- Ask questions
- Do the exercises
- Test ourselves
- We could try to teach the subject as we understand it to others
- I’d also recommend repeating it back to the teacher in your own words

## The power of metaphor

The more you can use metaphors to explain whatever you’re learning to either to yourself or to others, the more it can be helpful in creating those new neural patterns that are somewhat akin to the knowledge you already have.

You can explain even really complicated ideas using metaphors so that even kids can understand.

For example, if you’re learning electrical current flow, water is often used as the analogy for electrical current flow.

avoid any kind of music with lyrics in it when you’re studying, and avoid music that’s really loud.

>     任何技术都有其好坏，在解决一个问题的时候，也会带来新的问题。另外，一般来说，任何设计都有 trade-off（要什么和不要什么），所以，你要清楚这个技术的优势和劣势，以及带来的挑战。

> *   这个技术适用的场景。
>     任何技术都有其适用的场景，离开了这个场景，这个技术可能会有很多槽点，所以学习技术不但要知道这个技术是什么，还要知道其适用的场景。没有任何一个技术是普适的。注意，所谓场景一般分别两个，一个是业务场景，一个是技术场景。
